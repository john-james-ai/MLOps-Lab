	abstract = {Job recommender systems are desired to attain a high level of accuracy while making the predictions which are relevant to the customer, as it becomes a very tedious task to explore thousands of jobs, posted on the web, periodically. Although a lot of job recommender systems exist that uses different strategies , here efforts have been put to make the job recommendations on the basis of candidate's profile matching as well as preserving candidate's job behavior or preferences. Firstly, rules predicting the general preferences of the different user groups are mined. Then the job recommendations to the target candidate are made on the basis of content based matching as well as candidate preferences, which are preserved either in the form of mined rules or obtained by candidate's own applied jobs history. Through this technique a significant level of accuracy has been achieved over other basic methods of job recommendations.},

	doi = {10.1145/2492517.2500266},
	abstract = {This paper presents a content-based recommender system which proposes jobs to Facebook and LinkedIn users. A variant of this recommender system is currently used by Work4, a San Francisco-based software company that offers Facebook recruitment solutions. Work4 is the world leader in social recruitment technology; to use its applications, Facebook or LinkedIn users explicitly grant access to some parts of their data, and they are presented with the jobs whose descriptions are matching their profiles the most. The profile of a user contains two types of data: interactions data (user's own data) and social connections data (user's friends data). Furthermore the users profiles and the description of jobs are divided into several parts called fields. Our experiments suggest that to predict the users interests for jobs, using basic similarity measures together with their interactions data collected by Work4 can be improved upon. The second part of this study presents a method to estimate the importance of each field of users and jobs in the task of job recommendation. Finally, the third part is devoted to the use of a machine learning algorithm in order to improve the results obtained with similarity measures: we trained a linear SVM (Support Vector Machines). Our results show that using this supervised learning procedure increases the performance of our contentbased recommender system. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

	abstract = {Coordination failure reduces match quality among employers and candidates in the job market, resulting in a large number of unflled positions and/or unstable, short-term employment. Centralized job search engines provide a platform that connects directly employers with job-seekers. However, they require users to disclose a signifcant amount of personal data, i.e., build a user profle, in order to provide meaningful recommendations. In this paper, we present PrivateJobMatch - a privacy-oriented deferred multi-match recommender system - which generates stable pairings while requiring users to provide only a partial ranking of their preferences. PrivateJobMatch explores a series of adaptations of the game-theoretic Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm which combine the fexibility of decentralized markets with the intelligence of centralized matching. We identify the shortcomings of the original algorithm when applied to a job market and propose novel solutions that rely on machine learning techniques. Experimental results on real and synthetic data confrm the benefts of the proposed algorithms across several quality measures. Over the past year, we have implemented a PrivateJobMatch prototype and deployed it in an active job market economy. Using the gathered real-user preference data, we fnd that the match recommendations are superior to a typical decentralized job market-while requiring only a partial ranking of the user preferences.},

The system discussed in this work interprets a computer screen image in order to learn new keywords from the user's screen and associate them to new contexts in a completely unsupervised way, then produce action recommendations to assist the user. It can assist in automating various tasks such as genetics research, computer programming, engaging with social media, and legal research. The action recommendations are personalized to the user, and are produced without integration of the assistant into each individual application executing on the computer. Recommendations can be accepted with a single mouse click by the computer user.},

	abstract = {Traditional recommendation systems estimate user preference on items from past interaction history, thus suffering from the limitations of obtaining fine-grained and dynamic user preference. Conversational recommendation system (CRS) brings revolutions to those limitations by enabling the system to directly ask users about their preferred attributes on items. However, existing CRS methods do not make full use of such advantage — they only use the attribute feedback in rather implicit ways such as updating the latent user representation. In this paper, we propose Conversational Path Reasoning (CPR), a generic framework that models conversational recommendation as an interactive path reasoning problem on a graph. It walks through the attribute vertices by following user feedback, utilizing the user preferred attributes in an explicit way. By leveraging on the graph structure, CPR is able to prune off many irrelevant candidate attributes, leading to better chance of hitting user preferred attributes. To demonstrate how CPR works, we propose a simple yet effective instantiation named SCPR (Simple CPR). We perform empirical studies on the multi-round conversational recommendation scenario, the most realistic CRS setting so far that considers multiple rounds of asking attributes and recommending items. Through extensive experiments on two datasets Yelp and LastFM, we validate the effectiveness of our SCPR, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CRS methods EAR [13] and CRM [24]. In particular, we find that the more attributes there are, the more advantages our method can achieve.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems are software applications that help users to find items of interest in situations of information overload. Current research often assumes a one-shot interaction paradigm, where the users’ preferences are estimated based on past observed behavior and where the presentation of a ranked list of suggestions is the main, one-directional form of user interaction. Conversational recommender systems (CRS) take a different approach and support a richer set of interactions. These interactions can, for example, help to improve the preference elicitation process or allow the user to ask questions about the recommendations and to give feedback. The interest in CRS has significantly increased in the past few years. This development is mainly due to the significant progress in the area of natural language processing, the emergence of new voice-controlled home assistants, and the increased use of chatbot technology. With this article, we provide a detailed survey of existing approaches to conversational recommendation. We categorize these approaches in various dimensions, e.g., in terms of the supported user intents or the knowledge they use in the background. Moreover, we discuss technological approaches, review how CRS are evaluated, and finally identify a number of gaps that deserve more research in the future.},

Recommend systems based on different algorithms as one of the basic ways to reach this goal through the internet have been proposed but each of them has their own advantages and disadvantages. In this study, we have selected and implemented two approaches which are Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Social Network Recommendations System (SNRS). Based on some limitations to finding a dataset which covers friendship, rating and item categories we generated it for 10 categories, 10 items, and 100 users and compared two approaches. We used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and accuracy to compare the result of two mentioned approaches and found that the SNRS method as it is claimed to be improved version of CF works more efficiency.},

In this paper, we propose a co-attentive multitask learning model for explainable recommendation. Our model improves both prediction accuracy and explainability of recommendation by fully exploiting the correlations between the recommendation task and the explanation task. In particular, we design an encoder-selector-decoder architecture inspired by human’s information-processing model in cognitive psychology. We also propose a hierarchical co-attentive selector to effectively model the cross knowledge transferred for both tasks. Our model not only enhances prediction accuracy of the recommendation task, but also generates linguistic explanations that are ﬂuent, useful, and highly personalized. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

However, the research on this topic is very limited and existing solutions are either based on single round adhoc search engine or traditional multi round dialog system. They usually only utilize user inputs in the current session, ignoring users’ long term preferences. On the other hand, it is well known that sales conversion rate can be greatly improved based on recommender systems, which learn user preferences based on past purchasing behavior and optimize business oriented metrics such as conversion rate or expected revenue. In this work, we propose to integrate research in dialog systems and recommender systems into a novel and unified deep reinforcement learning framework to build a personalized conversational recommendation agent that optimizes a per session based utility function.},

In this paper, we investigate the combination of Digital Assistants and Conversational Recommender Systems (CoRSs) by designing and implementing a framework named ConveRSE (Conversational Recommender System framEwork), for building chatbots that can recommend items from different domains and interact with the user through natural language. Since a CoRS architecture is generally composed of different elements, we performed an in-vitro experiment with two synthetic datasets, to investigate the impact that each component has on the CoRS in terms of recommendation accuracy. Additionally, an in-vivo experiment was carried out to understand how natural language influences both the cost of interaction and recommendation accuracy of a CoRS. Experimental results have revealed the most critical components in a CoRS architecture, especially in cold-start situations, and the main issues of the natural-language-based interaction. All the dialogues have been collected in a public available dataset.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems have been attracting much attention from both academia and industry because of their ability to capture user interests and generate personalized item recommendations. As the life pace in contemporary society speeds up, traditional recommender systems are inevitably limited by their disconnected interaction styles and low adaptivity to users’ evolving demands. Consequently, conversational recommender systems emerge as a prospective research area, where an intelligent dialogue agent is integrated with a recommender system. Conversational recommender systems possess the ability to accurately understand end-users’ intent or request and generate human-like dialogue responses when performing recommendations. However, existing conversational recommender systems only allow the systems to ask users for more preference information, while users’ further questions and concerns about the recommended items (e.g., enquiring the location of a recommended restaurant) can hardly be addressed. Though the recent task-oriented dialogue systems allow for two-way communications, they are not easy to train because of their high dependence on human guidance in terms of user intent recognition and system response generation. Hence, to enable two-way human-machine communications and tackle the challenges brought by manually crafted rules, we propose Conversational Recommender System with Adversarial Learning (CRSAL), a novel end-to-end system to tackle the task of conversational recommendation. In CRSAL, we innovatively design a fully statistical dialogue state tracker coupled with a neural policy agent to precisely capture each user’s intent from limited dialogue data and generate conversational recommendation actions. We further develop an adversarial Actor-Critic reinforcement learning approach to adaptively refine the quality of generated system actions, thus ensuring coherent human-like dialogue responses. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets fully demonstrate the superiority of CRSAL on conversational recommendation tasks.},

	abstract = {Providing explanations for recommended items not only allows users to understand the reason for receiving recommendations but also provides users with an opportunity to re�ne recommendations by critiquing undesired parts of the explanation. While much research focuses on improving the explanation of recommendations, less e�ort has focused on interactive recommendation by allowing a user to critique explanations. Aside from traditional constraint- and utility-based critiquing systems, the only end-to-end deep learning based critiquing approach in the literature so far, CE-VNCF, su�ers from unstable and ine�cient training performance. In this paper, we propose a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based critiquing system to mitigate these issues and improve overall performance. The proposed model generates keyphrase-based explanations of recommendations and allows users to critique the generated explanations to re�ne their personalized recommendations. Our experiments show promising results: (1) The proposed model is competitive in terms of general performance in comparison to state-of-the-art recommenders, despite having an augmented loss function to support explanation and critiquing. (2) The proposed model can generate high-quality explanations compared to user or item keyphrase popularity baselines. (3) The proposed model is more e�ective in re�ning recommendations based on critiquing than CE-VNCF, where the rank of critiquing-a�ected items drops while general recommendation performance remains stable. In summary, this paper presents a signi�cantly improved method for multi-step deep critiquing based recommender systems based on the VAE framework.},

The utility of recommender systems cannot be overstated, given its widespread adoption in many web applications, along with its potential impact to ameliorate many problems related to over-choice. In recent years, deep learning has garnered considerable interest in many research fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, owing not only to stellar performance but also the attractive property of learning feature representations from scratch. The influence of deep learning is also pervasive, recently demonstrating its effectiveness when applied to information retrieval and recommender systems research. Evidently, the field of deep learning in recommender system is flourishing. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on deep learning based recommender systems. More concretely, we provide and devise a taxonomy of deep learning based recommendation models, along with providing a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art.

	abstract = {For better user satisfaction and business effectiveness, Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is one of the most important tasks in Ecommerce. It is often the case that users’ interests different from their past routines may emerge or impressions such as promotional items may burst in a very short period. In essence, such changes relate to item evolution problem, which has not been investigated by previous studies. The state-of-the-art methods in the sequential recommendation, which use simple user behaviors, are incapable of modeling these changes sufficiently. It is because, in the user behaviors, outdated interests may exist and the popularity of an item over time is not well represented. To address these limitations, we introduce time-aware item behaviors for addressing the recommendation of emerging preference. The time-aware item behavior for an item is a set of users who interact with this item with timestamps. The rich interaction information of users for an item may help to model its evolution. In this work, we propose a CTR prediction model TIEN based on the time-aware item behavior. In TIEN, by leveraging the interaction time intervals, information of similar users in a short time interval helps identify the emerging user interest of the target user. By using the sequential time intervals, the item’s popularity over time can be captured in evolutionary item dynamics. Noisy users who interact with items accidentally are further eliminated thus learning robust personalized item dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to the item evolution problem for E-commerce CTR prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world CTR prediction datasets. The results show that the TIEN model consistently achieves remarkable improvements to the state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe a method for computing item based recommendations using matrix-factorization-like embeddings of the items computed using a neural network. Matrix factorizations (MF) compute near optimal item embeddings by minimizing a loss that measures the discrepancy between the predicted and known values of a sparse user-item rating matrix. Though useful for recommendation tasks, they are computationally intensive and hard to compute for large sets of users and items. Hence there is need to compute MF-like embeddings using other less computationally intensive methods, which can be substituted for the actual ones. In this work we explore the possibility of doing the same using a deep neural network (DNN). Our network is trained to learn matrix-factorizationlike embeddings from easy to compute natural language processing (NLP) based semantic embeddings. The resulting MF-like embeddings are used to compute recommendations using an anonymized user product engagement dataset from the online retail company Overstock.com. We present the results of using our embeddings for computing recommendations with the Overstock.com production dataset consisting of ∼3.5 million items and ∼6 million users. Recommendations from Overstock.com’s own recommendation system is compared against those obtained by using our MF-like embeddings, by comparing the results from both to the ground truth, which in our case is actual user co-clicks data. Our results show that it is possible to use DNNs for efficiently computing MFlike embeddings which can then be used in conjunction with the NLP based embeddings to improve the recommendations obtained from the NLP based embeddings.},

This paper addresses both challenges in the context of constraintbased recommenders where users specify their requirements and the system recommends a solution. We propose a novel approach to determine value ordering heuristics on the basis of matrix factorization. As far as we are aware, no researches exist in constraint-based recommendation domain which exploit matrix factorization techniques. The main idea of our approach consists in the prediction of value ordering heuristics based on historical transactions which can either represent past customer purchases or requirements. Thereby, value ordering heuristics are computed which are specific to each user’s requirements. A series of experiments on real-world datasets for calculating constraint-based recommendations has shown that our approach outperforms compared methods in terms of runtime efficiency and prediction quality.},

	abstract = {Product feature recommendations are critical for online customers to purchase the right products based on the right features. For a customer, selecting the product that has the best trade-off between price and functionality is a time-consuming step in an online shopping experience, and customers can be overwhelmed by the available choices. However, determining the set of product features that most differentiate a particular product is still an open question in online recommender systems. In this paper, we focus on using interpretable machine learning methods to tackle this problem. First, we identify this unique product feature recommendation problem from a business perspective on a major US e-commerce site. Second, we formulate the problem into a price-driven supervised learning problem to discover the product features that could best explain the price of a product in a given product category. We build machine learning models with a model-agnostic method Shapley Values to understand the importance of each feature, rank and recommend the most essential features. Third, we leverage human experts to evaluate its relevancy. The results show that our method is superior to a strong baseline method based on customer behavior and significantly boosts the coverage by 45\%. Finally, our proposed method shows comparable conversion rate against the baseline in online A/B tests.},

However, the natural sparsity of user-item rating data can be problematic in many domains and settings, limiting the ability to generate accurate predictions and effective recommendations. Moreover, in some CF approaches latent features are often used to represent users and items, which can lead to a lack of recommendation transparency and explainability. User-generated, customer reviews are now commonplace on many websites, providing users with an opportunity to convey their experiences and opinions of products and services. As such, these reviews have the potential to serve as a useful source of recommendation data, through capturing valuable sentiment information about particular product features. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning recommendation model, which co-learns user and item information from ratings and customer reviews, by optimizing matrix factorization and an attention-based GRU network. Using real-world datasets we show a significant improvement in recommendation performance, compared to a variety of alternatives. Furthermore, the approach is useful when it comes to assigning intuitive meanings to latent features to improve the transparency and explainability of recommender systems.},

	abstract = {Reviews information is dominant for users to make online purchasing decisions in e-commerces. However, the usefulness of reviews is varied. We argue that less-useful reviews hurt model’s performance, and are also less meaningful for user’s reference. While some existing models utilize reviews for improving the performance of recommender systems, few of them consider the usefulness of reviews for recommendation quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to explore the usefulness of reviews, and propose a Neural Attentional Regression model with Review-level Explanations (NARRE) for recommendation. Speci cally, NARRE can not only predict precise ratings, but also learn the usefulness of each review simultaneously. Therefore, the highly-useful reviews are obtained which provide review-level explanations to help users make better and faster decisions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets of Amazon and Yelp on di erent domains show that the proposed NARRE model consistently outperforms the state-ofthe-art recommendation approaches, including PMF, NMF, SVD++, HFT, and DeepCoNN in terms of rating prediction, by the proposed attention model that takes review usefulness into consideration. Furthermore, the selected reviews are shown to be e ective when taking existing review-usefulness ratings in the system as ground truth. Besides, crowd-sourcing based evaluations reveal that in most cases, NARRE achieves equal or even better performances than system’s usefulness rating method in selecting reviews. And it is exible to o er great help on the dominant cases in real ecommerce scenarios when the ratings on review-usefulness are not available in the system.},

	abstract = {Recently, many e-commerce websites have encouraged their users to rate shopping items and write review texts. This review information has been very useful for understanding user preferences and item properties, as well as enhancing the capability to make personalized recommendations of these websites. In this paper, we propose to model user preferences and item properties using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dual local and global attention, motivated by the superiority of CNNs to extract complex features. By using aggregated review texts from a user and aggregated review text for an item, our model can learn the unique features (embedding) of each user and each item. These features are then used to predict ratings. We train these user and item networks jointly which enable the interaction between users and items in a similar way as matrix factorization. The local attention provides us insight on a user’s preferences or an item’s properties. The global attention helps CNNs focus on the semantic meaning of the whole review text. Thus, the combined local and global attentions enable an interpretable and better-learned representation of users and items. We validate the proposed models by testing on popular review datasets in Yelp and Amazon and compare the results with matrix factorization (MF), the hidden factor and topical (HFT) model, and the recently proposed convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF+). Our proposed CNNs with dual attention model outperforms HFT and ConvMF+ in terms of mean square errors (MSE). In addition, we compare the user/item embeddings learned from these models for classi cation and recommendation. These results also con rm the superior quality of user/item embeddings learned from our model.},

While promising, we demonstrate that existing approaches struggle (in terms of both quality and content) to generate justiﬁcations that are relevant to users’ decision-making process. We seek to introduce new datasets and methods to address this recommendation justiﬁcation task. In terms of data, we ﬁrst propose an ‘extractive’ approach to identify review segments which justify users’ intentions; this approach is then used to distantly label massive review corpora and construct largescale personalized recommendation justiﬁcation datasets. In terms of generation, we design two personalized generation models with this data: (1) a reference-based Seq2Seq model with aspect-planning which can generate justiﬁcations covering different aspects, and (2) an aspect-conditional masked language model which can generate diverse justiﬁcations based on templates extracted from justiﬁcation histories. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets which show that our model is capable of generating convincing and diverse justiﬁcations.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a recommendation system must choose between a set of candidate approaches. A ﬁrst step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice. Indeed, recommendation systems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss how to compare recommenders based on a set of properties that are relevant for the application. We focus on comparative studies, where a few algorithms are compared using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms. We describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms. We review three types of experiments, starting with an ofﬂine setting, where recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and report on the experience, and ﬁnally describe large scale online experiments, where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for experimentation. We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from the conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how to evaluate systems given relevant properties. We also survey a large set of evaluation metrics in the context of the property that they evaluate.},

	abstract = {The collaborative filtering method is widely used in the traditional recommendation system. The collaborative filtering method based on matrix factorization treats the user’s preference for the item as a linear combination of the user and the item latent vectors, and cannot learn a deeper feature representation. In addition, the cold start and data sparsity remain major problems for collaborative filtering. To tackle these problems, some scholars have proposed to use deep neural network to extract text information, but did not consider the impact of long-distance dependent information and key information on their models. In this paper, we propose a neural collaborative filtering recommender method that integrates user and item auxiliary information. This method fully integrates user-item rating information, user assistance information and item text assistance information for feature extraction. First, Stacked Denoising Auto Encoder is used to extract user features, and Gated Recurrent Unit with auxiliary information is used to extract items’ latent vectors, respectively. The attention mechanism is used to learn key information when extracting text features. Second, the latent vectors learned by deep learning techniques are used in multi-layer nonlinear networks to learn more abstract and deeper feature representations to predict user preferences. According to the verification results on the MovieLens data set, the proposed model outperforms other traditional approaches and deep learning models making it state of the art.},

In this research, we predict consumer opinion based on mobile phone reviews, in addition to providing an analysis of the most important factors behind reviews being classiﬁed as either positive, negative, or neutral. This insight could help companies improve their products as well as helping potential buyers to make the right decision. The research presented in this paper was carried out as follows: the data was pre-processed, before being converted from text to vector representation using a range of feature extraction techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, Glove, and word2vec. We study the performance of different machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent, naive Bayes and convolutional neural networks. In addition, we evaluate our models using accuracy, F1score, precision, recall and log loss function. Moreover, we apply Lime technique to provide analytical reasons for the reviews being classiﬁed as either positive, negative or neutral. Our experiments revealed that convolutional neural network with word2vec as a feature extraction technique provides the best results for both the unbalanced and balanced versions of the dataset.},

In comparison to traditional machine learning methods such as decision trees and support vector machines, deep learning methods have achieved substantial improvement in various prediction tasks. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are comparably weak in explaining their inference processes and ﬁnal results, and they are typically treated as a black-box by both developers and users. Some people even consider DNNs (deep neural networks) in the current stage rather as alchemy, than as real science. In many real-world applications such as business decision, process optimization, medical diagnosis and investment recommendation, explainability and transparency of our AI systems become particularly essential for their users, for the people who are aﬀected by AI decisions, and furthermore, for the researchers and developers who create the AI solutions. In recent years, the explainability and explainable AI have received increasing attention by both research community and industry. This paper ﬁrst introduces the history of Explainable AI, starting from expert systems and traditional machine learning approaches to the latest progress in the context of modern deep learning, and then describes the major research areas and the state-ofart approaches in recent years.

Our training data includes only sentences labeled with their attribute (e.g., positive or negative), but not pairs of sentences that differ only in their attributes, so we must learn to disentangle attributes from attributeindependent content in an unsupervised way. Previous work using adversarial methods has struggled to produce high-quality outputs. In this paper, we propose simpler methods motivated by the observation that text attributes are often marked by distinctive phrases (e.g., “too small”). Our strongest method extracts content words by deleting phrases associated with the sentence’s original attribute value, retrieves new phrases associated with the target attribute, and uses a neural model to ﬂuently combine these into a ﬁnal output. On human evaluation, our best method generates grammatical and appropriate responses on 22\% more inputs than the best previous system, averaged over three attribute transfer datasets: altering sentiment of reviews on Yelp, altering sentiment of reviews on Amazon, and altering image captions to be more romantic or humorous.},

	abstract = {Undirected neural sequence models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) have received renewed interest due to their success on discriminative natural language understanding tasks such as questionanswering and natural language inference. The problem of generating sequences directly from these models has received relatively little attention, in part because generating from undirected models departs signiﬁcantly from conventional monotonic generation in directed sequence models. We investigate this problem by proposing a generalized model of sequence generation that uniﬁes decoding in directed and undirected models. The proposed framework models the process of generation rather than the resulting sequence, and under this framework, we derive various neural sequence models as special cases, such as autoregressive, semi-autoregressive, and reﬁnementbased non-autoregressive models. This uniﬁcation enables us to adapt decoding algorithms originally developed for directed sequence models to undirected sequence models. We demonstrate this by evaluating various handcrafted and learned decoding strategies on a BERT-like machine translation model (Lample \& Conneau, 2019). The proposed approach achieves constant-time translation results on par with linear-time translation results from the same undirected sequence model, while both are competitive with the state-of-theart on WMT’14 English-German translation.},

We test the technique on the problem of Text Summarization (TS). Extractive TS relies on the concept of sentence salience to identify the most important sentences in a document or set of documents. Salience is typically deﬁned in terms of the presence of particular important words or in terms of similarity to a centroid pseudo-sentence. We consider a new approach, LexRank, for computing sentence importance based on the concept of eigenvector centrality in a graph representation of sentences. In this model, a connectivity matrix based on intra-sentence cosine similarity is used as the adjacency matrix of the graph representation of sentences. Our system, based on LexRank ranked in ﬁrst place in more than one task in the recent DUC 2004 evaluation. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of our approach and apply it to a larger data set including data from earlier DUC evaluations. We discuss several methods to compute centrality using the similarity graph. The results show that degree-based methods (including LexRank) outperform both centroid-based methods and other systems participating in DUC in most of the cases. Furthermore, the LexRank with threshold method outperforms the other degree-based techniques including continuous LexRank. We also show that our approach is quite insensitive to the noise in the data that may result from an imperfect topical clustering of documents.},

Traditional natural language generation methods rely extensively on hand-crafted rules and predeﬁned templates. This paper presents an attention-enhanced attribute-to-sequence model to generate product reviews for given attribute information, such as user, product, and rating. The attribute encoder learns to represent input attributes as vectors. Then, the sequence decoder generates reviews by conditioning its output on these vectors. We also introduce an attention mechanism to jointly generate reviews and align words with input attributes. The proposed model is trained end-to-end to maximize the likelihood of target product reviews given the attributes. We build a publicly available dataset for the review generation task by leveraging the Amazon book reviews and their metadata. Experiments on the dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods and the attention mechanism significantly improves the performance of our model.},

	abstract = {Existing recommender systems in the e-commerce domain primarily focus on generating a set of relevant items as recommendations; however, few existing systems utilize underlying item attributes as a key organizing principle in presenting recommendations to users. Mining important attributes of items from customer perspectives and presenting them along with item sets as recommendations can provide users more explainability and help them make better purchase decision. In this work, we generalize the attribute-aware item-set recommendation problem, and develop a new approach to generate sets of items (recommendations) with corresponding important attributes (explanations) that can best justify why the items are recommended to users. In particular, we propose a system that learns important attributes from historical user behavior to derive item set recommendations, so that an organized view of recommendations and their attribute-driven explanations can help users more easily understand how the recommendations relate to their preferences. Our approach is geared towards real world scenarios: we expect a solution to be scalable to billions of items, and be able to learn item and attribute relevance automatically from user behavior without human annotations. To this end, we propose a multi-step learning-based framework called Extract-Expect-Explain (EX3), which is able to adaptively select recommended items and important attributes for users. We experiment on a large-scale realworld benchmark and the results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an 11.35\% increase on NDCG with adaptive explainability for item set recommendation.},

While fairly successful, these methods usually do not produce highly coherent aspects. In this paper, we present a novel neural approach with the aim of discovering coherent aspects. The model improves coherence by exploiting the distribution of word co-occurrences through the use of neural word embeddings. Unlike topic models which typically assume independently generated words, word embedding models encourage words that appear in similar contexts to be located close to each other in the embedding space. In addition, we use an attention mechanism to de-emphasize irrelevant words during training, further improving the coherence of aspects. Experimental results on real-life datasets demonstrate that our approach discovers more meaningful and coherent aspects, and substantially outperforms baseline methods on several evaluation tasks.},

	abstract = {Review based recommendation utilizes both users’ rating records and the associated reviews for recommendation. Recently, with the rapid demand for explanations of recommendation results, reviews are used to train the encoder–decoder models for explanation text generation. As most of the reviews are general text without detailed evaluation, some researchers leveraged auxiliary information of users or items to enrich the generated explanation text. Nevertheless, the auxiliary data is not available in most scenarios and may suffer from data privacy problems. In this article, we argue that the reviews contain abundant semantic information to express the users’ feelings for various aspects of items, while these information are not fully explored in current explanation text generation task. To this end, we study how to generate more fine-grained explanation text in review based recommendation without any auxiliary data. Though the idea is simple, it is non-trivial since the aspect is hidden and unlabeled. Besides, it is also very challenging to inject aspect information for generating explanation text with noisy review input. To solve these challenges, we first leverage an advanced unsupervised neural aspect extraction model to learn the aspect-aware representation of each review sentence. Thus, users and items can be represented in the aspect space based on their historical associated reviews. After that, we detail how to better predict ratings and generate explanation text with the user and item representations in the aspect space. We further dynamically assign review sentences which contain larger proportion of aspect words with larger weights to control the text generation process, and jointly optimize rating prediction accuracy and explanation text generation quality with a multi-task learning framework. Finally, extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model for both recommendation accuracy and explainability.},

We present a novel feature mapping approach that maps the uninterpretable general features onto the interpretable aspect features, achieving both satisfactory accuracy and explainability in the recommendations by simultaneous minimization of rating prediction loss and interpretation loss. To evaluate the explainability, we propose two new evaluation metrics speciﬁcally designed for aspect-level explanation using surrogate ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate a strong performance in both recommendation and explaining explanation, eliminating the need for metadata. Code is available from https://github.com/pd90506/AMCF.},

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

	abstract = {Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to provide high-quality recommendations through fewer multiturn conversations. However, because short conversation histories lack sufficient item information, CRSs not only struggle to make accurate recommendations but also lack diversity in the generated responses. Existing CRSs mainly alleviate these problems by introducing external information (e.g., reviews) while ignoring information inside the conversations (e.g., potential category preferences in user utterances). Besides, item introduction is a kind of external information that is more objective and contains more entities than reviews. Therefore, we propose a Multi-information Augmented Conversational Recommender (MACR), which improves the performance of recommendation and response generation by mining the underlying category preferences in users’ utterances and incorporating item introductions. Specifically, we enhance the category associations among entities by constructing a knowledge graph DBMG with category nodes, extracting and encoding the item categories that match the user preferences into the user representation. For item introductions, we extract the entities in them and fuse them into the conversation using an introduction-attentive encoder–decoder. Extensive experiments on the dataset REDIAL show that our MACR significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches. The source code will be available at https://github.com/zcy-cqut/MACR.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems exploit interaction history to estimate user preference, having been heavily used in a wide range of industry applications. However, static recommendation models are difficult to answer two important questions well due to inherent shortcomings: (a) What exactly does a user like? (b) Why does a user like an item? The shortcomings are due to the way that static models learn user preference, i.e., without explicit instructions and active feedback from users. The recent rise of conversational recommender systems (CRSs) changes this situation fundamentally. In a CRS, users and the system can dynamically communicate through natural language interactions, which provide unprecedented opportunities to explicitly obtain the exact preference of users. Considerable efforts, spread across disparate settings and applications, have been put into developing CRSs. Existing models, technologies, and evaluation methods for CRSs are far from mature. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of the techniques used in current CRSs. We summarize the key challenges of developing CRSs in five directions: (1) Question-based user preference elicitation. (2) Multi-turn conversational recommendation strategies. (3) Dialogue understanding and generation. (4) Exploitation-exploration trade-offs. (5) Evaluation and user simulation. These research directions involve multiple research fields like information retrieval (IR), natural language processing (NLP), and human-computer interaction (HCI). Based on these research directions, we discuss some future challenges and opportunities. We provide a road map for researchers from multiple com­ munities to get started in this area. We hope this survey can help to identify and address challenges in CRSs and inspire future research.},

In conversational recommendation approaches, the system acquires needs and preferences in an interactive, multi-turn dialog. This is usually driven by incrementally asking users about their preferences about item features or individual items. A central research goal in this context is efﬁciency, evaluated concerning the number of required interactions until a satisfying item is found. Today, research on dialog efﬁciency is almost entirely empirical, aiming to demonstrate, for example, that one strategy for selecting questions to ask the user is better than another one in a given application. This work complements empirical research with a theoretical, domain-independent model of conversational recommendation. This model, designed to cover a range of application scenarios, allows us to investigate the efﬁciency of conversational approaches in a formal way, particularly concerning the computational complexity of devising optimal interaction strategies. An experimental evaluation empirically conﬁrms our ﬁndings.},

With the framework of dual modes of information-processing models, we hypothesized that the personalization of messages would be a central route with a greater impact on attitude for products with high involvement. By contrast, the social role of the conversational agent was expected to represent a peripheral route with a greater impact on products with low involvement. An experimental study was designed to test the effects of personalized content that reflected individual preferences for product attributes and a friend role of a voice agent with high and low product involvement. The results showed main effects of both personalization and the social role on building attitudes toward the product. Although no interaction effect for personalization and involvement was found, there was a significant interaction effect for the social role and involvement. This study contributes to persuasion theory by extending it to the interaction with a conversational agent.

	abstract = {Healthcare systems across the world are transitioning into patient-centered healthcare models to ensure improved health outcomes, increased operational efficiencies and respectful patient engagement. Digital health technologies are at the forefront of this transition in facilitating a role for the patient in the clinical dimensions of the healthcare trajectory, from diagnosis and interventions to treatment and recovery. Despite this prevalence in the clinical space, the non-clinical needs of patient mental health and wellbeing are frequently overlooked by contemporary patient-centered healthcare models. Conversational agents (or chatbots) are digital dialogue systems that are widespread and widely used in sequential information provision and information acquisition tasks. Given the intimate nature of this human-machine interaction, conversational agents can be effectively utilized to support and sustain patient mental health and wellbeing. In this paper, we propose an empathic conversational agent framework based on an ensemble of natural language processing techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms for real-time monitoring and co-facilitation of patient-centered healthcare for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes. The technical contributions of this framework are; detection of patient emotions, prediction of patient emotion transitions, detection of group emotions, formulation of patient behavioral metrics, and resource recommendations based on patient concerns. The architectural contributions of the framework are intelligent communication channels that stream empathic conversational elements and resource recommendations for the multi-user conversations and co-facilitation updates for the human healthcare provider interface. The framework was empirically evaluated on a benchmark dataset and further validated based on a clinical protocol designed for its application in an online support group setting for cancer patients and caregivers in Canada. The results of these experiments confirm the effectiveness of this framework, its contributory role and practical value in realizing a patient-centered healthcare model for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes.},

Methods: Women were randomized to either 1) an ECA (content included: mindfulness, stress management, physical activity, and healthy eating) or 2) patient education sheets mirroring same content plus a meditation CD/MP3 once a day for one month. General outcome measures included: number of stress management techniques used, physical activity levels, and eating patterns.
Results: Sixty-one women ages 18 to 50 were enrolled. On average, 51\% identiﬁed as white, 26\% as black, 23\% as other races; and 20\% as Hispanic. The major stress management techniques reported at baseline were: exercise (69\%), listening to music (70\%), and social support (66\%). After one month, women randomized to the ECA signiﬁcantly decreased alcohol consumption to reduce stress (p = 0.03) and increased daily fruit consumption by an average of 2 servings compared to the control (p = 0.04).
Conclusion: It is feasible to use an ECA to promote health behaviors on stress management and healthy eating among diverse urban women. Practice implications: Compared to patient information sheets, ECAs provide promise as a way to teach healthy lifestyle behaviors to diverse urban women.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems aim to estimate item ratings and recommend items based on the users’ interests. The traditional recommender systems generally consider user–item rating information for rating prediction, but they suffer from various limitations, such as data sparsity, black-box recommendation, and cold-start problems. As a result, researchers have proposed amalgamating contextual information with rating data to provide effective recommendations. Although user-generated data in the form of reviews are a rich source of contextual information, they are rarely utilized in recommender algorithms. This study presents a hybrid recommendation technique, called RecTE, using rating data and topic embedding, which is an amalgamation of word embedding and topic modeling techniques. The novelty of RecTE lies in predicting item ratings using topic embeddings learned by incorporating local and global contextual information and integrating them with user-based collaborative filtering. RecTE is empirically evaluated over three real-world datasets – YelpNYC, YelpZip and TripAdvisor. This technique performs significantly better in comparison to nine baselines and five state-of-the-art recommendation techniques. On empirical analysis, we found that incorporating topic embedding in RecTE makes it capable of performing significantly better and handle cold-start problems effectively in comparison to the existing recommendation approaches.},

The current recommendation methods cannot guarantee the effectiveness and accuracy of course recommendation, especially when a user has enrolled in many different courses. Because these methods fail to distinguish the most relevant historical courses, which can contribute to predicting the target course that indeed reflects the user’s interests from her sequential learning behaviors. In this paper, we propose a context-aware reinforcement learning method, named Hierarchical and Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (HRRL), to efficiently reconstruct user profiles for course recommendation. The key ingredient of our scheme is the novel interaction between an attention-based recommendation model and a profile reviser with Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RRL) that exploits temporal context. To this aim, a contextual policy gradient with approximation is proposed for RRL. By employing RRL in hierarchical tasks of revising user profiles, the proposed HRRL model enables reliable convergence in revising policy learning and improves the recommendation accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by experiments on two open online courses datasets. Empirical results show that HRRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are dedicated to providing learners with large-scale and open-access boutique courses. Recently, the course recommendation algorithm in MOOCs has attracted many researchers’ attention. Compared with ordinary recommendation scenarios, course interaction density in MOOCs is more tenuous, since it demands lots of time and gumption of learners. Meanwhile, the connections and semantic information among courses are much more diversiform and plentiful. Therefore, knowledge graph enhanced recommendation algorithms are appropriate for addressing the course recommendation problem in MOOCs scenario. According to relevant research on KG-based algorithms, utilization efficiency of edge information seems to be the key to boosting model effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a high-performance course recommendation model named Knowledge Grouping Aggregation Network (KGAN), which uses the course graph (a heterogeneous graph for describing the relations between courses and facts) to estimate learners’ potential interests automatically and iteratively. More precisely, KGAN constructs an end-to-end recommendation model, which projects the learner’s behavior and course graph into a unified space naturally, which alleviates difficulties in course recommendation such as interaction tenuous, course relevance, and intention diversity. In addition, we proposed intra-group and inter-group attention operator, which packages the propagation set according to the relation-links and obtains the corresponding attention priorities of different entities under different paths for constructing a reasonable and explicit encoding of users. We apply the proposed model on the real-world datasets, and the empirical results demonstrate that KGAN outperforms compelling state-of-the-art baselines. Our implementations are available at https://github.com/StZHY/KGAN.},

To address these issues, we propose a Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SSRL) framework combined with dual-reward for knowledgeaware recommendation reasoning over knowledge graphs. Then, we improve Actor-Critic algorithm by using a dual-reward driven strategy, which combines short-term reward with long-term incremental evaluation. The improved algorithm helps the policy guide path reasoning in an overall situation. In addition, to ﬁnd the most potential paths, in the improved Actor-Critic algorithm, a loss constraint of each sample is used as a reinforced signal to update the gradients. With some improvements against baselines, experimental results demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our framework.},

By this mechanism, the system is able to imitate natural conversation between customer and professional sales support, for eliciting customer preference. However, many customers are not familiar with the technical features of multifunction and multi-feature products. A more natural way to explore customer preferences is by asking what they want to use with the product they are looking for (product functional requirements). Therefore, this paper proposes a computational model incorporating product functional requirements for interaction. The proposed model covers ontology and its structure as well as algorithms for generating interaction that comprises asking question, recommending products and presenting explanation of why a product is recommended. Based on our user studies, both expert users (familiar with product technical features) and novice users (not familiar with product technical feature) prefer our proposed interaction model than that of the flat interaction model (interaction model based on technical features). Meanwhile, functional requirements-based explanation is able to improve user trust in recommended products by 30\% for novice users and 17\% for expert users.},

As a result, the article provides the answers of three general, three focused, and two statistical questions to address the role of artificial intelligence in conversational agents applied to business domains. In this regard, the results show that no study combines self-learning, personalization, and generative-based responses for the same business solution. Additionally, the article describes the organization of the state-of-the-art, highlighting the correlation of business perspectives and machine learning methods.

Using real-time motion capture and content coding of recordings as well as self-reports, several data sources were considered: hand velocity as an indicator of gesturing, observed levels of engagement and remembered conversational content. Gesturing, in contrast to other indicators of engagement, was reduced under high mobility constraints and was more pronounced under low constraints. Gesturing was further positively related to observed engagement. Additionally, lower constraints resulted in more memories of conversational content. These ﬁndings emphasise the relevance of mobility constraints and bodily movement during mediated interaction and call for further model development in computer-mediated communication. Potential for application lies in interactive scenarios such as remote interviewing, testimonials, and relationship maintenance.},

	abstract = {We investigate a growing body of work that seeks to improve recommender systems through the use of review text. Generally, these papers argue that since reviews ‘explain’ users’ opinions, they ought to be useful to infer the underlying dimensions that predict ratings or purchases. Schemes to incorporate reviews range from simple regularizers to neural network approaches. Our initial findings reveal several discrepancies in reported results, partly due to (e.g.) copying results across papers despite changes in experimental settings or data pre-processing. First, we attempt a comprehensive analysis to resolve these ambiguities. Further investigation calls for discussion on a much larger problem about the “importance" of user reviews for recommendation. Through a wide range of experiments, we observe several cases where state-of-the-art methods fail to outperform existing baselines, especially as we deviate from a few narrowly-defined settings where reviews are useful. We conclude by providing hypotheses for our observations, that seek to characterize under what conditions reviews are likely to be helpful. Through this work, we aim to evaluate the direction in which the field is progressing and encourage robust empirical evaluation.},

	abstract = {We address an important problem in sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning referred to as copying, in which certain segments in the input sequence are selectively replicated in the output sequence. A similar phenomenon is observable in human language communication. For example, humans tend to repeat entity names or even long phrases in conversation. The challenge with regard to copying in Seq2Seq is that new machinery is needed to decide when to perform the operation. In this paper, we incorporate copying into neural networkbased Seq2Seq learning and propose a new model called COPYNET with encoderdecoder structure. COPYNET can nicely integrate the regular way of word generation in the decoder with the new copying mechanism which can choose subsequences in the input sequence and put them at proper places in the output sequence. Our empirical study on both synthetic data sets and real world data sets demonstrates the efﬁcacy of COPYNET. For example, COPYNET can outperform regular RNN-based model with remarkable margins on text summarization tasks.},

We cast this problem using an encoder-decoder framework that generates personalized reviews by expanding short phrases (e.g. review summaries, product titles) provided as input to the system. We incorporate aspect-level information via an aspect encoder that learns ‘aspect-aware’ user and item representations. An attention fusion layer is applied to control generation by attending on the outputs of multiple encoders. Experimental results show that our model is capable of generating coherent and diverse reviews that expand the contents of input phrases. In addition, the learned aspectaware representations discover those aspects that users are more inclined to discuss and bias the generated text toward their personalized aspect preferences.},

They are generally trained to build a 1-to-1 mapping from the input post to its output response. However, a given post is often associated with multiple replies simultaneously in real applications. Previous research on this task mainly focuses on improving the relevance and informativeness of the top one generated response for each post. Very few works study generating multiple accurate and diverse responses for the same post. In this paper, we propose a novel response generation model, which considers a set of responses jointly and generates multiple diverse responses simultaneously. A reinforcement learning algorithm is designed to solve our model. Experiments on two short-text conversation tasks validate that the multiple responses generated by our model obtain higher quality and larger diversity compared with various state-ofthe-art generative models.},

This is due to the limitations of likelihoodbased decoding objectives in generation tasks with diverse outputs, such as conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach for incorporating side information in the form of distributional constraints over the generated responses. We propose two constraints that help generate more content rich responses that are based on a model of syntax and topics (Grifﬁths et al., 2005) and semantic similarity (Arora et al., 2016). We evaluate our approach against a variety of competitive baselines, using both automatic metrics and human judgments, showing that our proposed approach generates responses that are much less generic without sacriﬁcing plausibility.

The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder–Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model.

	abstract = {Recently, some E-commerce sites launch a new interaction box called Tips on their mobile apps. Users can express their experience and feelings or provide suggestions using short texts typically several words or one sentence. In essence, writing some tips and giving a numerical rating are two facets of a user’s product assessment action, expressing the user experience and feelings. Jointly modeling these two facets is helpful for designing a better recommendation system. While some existing models integrate text information such as item specifications or user reviews into user and item latent factors for improving the rating prediction, no existing works consider tips for improving recommendation quality. We propose a deep learning based framework named NRT which can simultaneously predict precise ratings and generate abstractive tips with good linguistic quality simulating user experience and feelings. For abstractive tips generation, gated recurrent neural networks are employed to “translate” user and item latent representations into a concise sentence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets from different domains show that NRT achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the generated tips can vividly predict the user experience and feelings.},

In this paper, we present a deep model to learn item properties and user behaviors jointly from review text. The proposed model, named Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN), consists of two parallel neural networks coupled in the last layers. One of the networks focuses on learning user behaviors exploiting reviews written by the user, and the other one learns item properties from the reviews written for the item. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together. The shared layer enables latent factors learned for users and items to interact with each other in a manner similar to factorization machine techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepCoNN signiﬁcantly outperforms all baseline recommender systems on a variety of datasets.},

In this work, we develop a multi-task learning solution for explainable recommendation. Two companion learning tasks of user preference modeling for recommendation and opinionated content modeling for explanation are integrated via a joint tensor factorization. As a result, the algorithm predicts not only a user’s preference over a list of items, i.e., recommendation, but also how the user would appreciate a particular item at the feature level, i.e., opinionated textual explanation. Extensive experiments on two large collections of Amazon and Yelp reviews confirmed the effectiveness of our solution in both recommendation and explanation tasks, compared with several existing recommendation algorithms. And our extensive user study clearly demonstrates the practical value of the explainable recommendations generated by our algorithm.},

Specifically, we build regression trees on users and items respectively with usergenerated reviews, and associate a latent profile to each node on the trees to represent users and items. With the growth of regression tree, the latent factors are gradually refined under the regularization imposed by the tree structure. As a result, we are able to track the creation of latent profiles by looking into the path of each factor on regression trees, which thus serves as an explanation for the resulting recommendations. Extensive experiments on two large collections of Amazon and Yelp reviews demonstrate the advantage of our model over several competitive baseline algorithms.

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Unlike most existing approaches that only focus on leveraging knowledge graphs for more accurate recommendation, we perform explicit reasoning with knowledge for decision making so that the recommendations are generated and supported by an interpretable causal inference procedure. To this end, we propose a method called Policy-Guided Path Reasoning (PGPR), which couples recommendation and interpretability by providing actual paths in a knowledge graph. Our contributions include four aspects. We first highlight the significance of incorporating knowledge graphs into recommendation to formally define and interpret the reasoning process. Second, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach featuring an innovative soft reward strategy, user-conditional action pruning and a multi-hop scoring function. Third, we design a policy-guided graph search algorithm to efficiently and effectively sample reasoning paths for recommendation. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method on several large-scale real-world benchmark datasets, obtaining favorable results compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

In this paper, we first contribute with two hierarchical taxonomies for classifying user intents and recommender actions respectively based on grounded theory. We then define various categories of feature considering content, discourse, sentiment, and context to predict users’ intents and satisfaction by comparing different machine learning methods. The experimental results for user intent prediction task show that some models (such as XGBoost and SVM) can perform well in predicting user intents, and incorporating context features into the prediction model can significantly boost the performance. Our empirical study also demonstrates that leveraging dialogue behavior features (i.e., including both user intents and recommender actions) can achieve good results in predicting user satisfaction.},

With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features.

In most existing deep learning models, feature interactions are either manually designed or simply enumerated. However, enumerating all feature interactions brings large memory and computation cost. Even worse, useless interactions may introduce noise and complicate the training process. In this work, we propose a two-stage algorithm called Automatic Feature Interaction Selection (AutoFIS). AutoFIS can automatically identify important feature interactions for factorization models with computational cost just equivalent to training the target model to convergence. In the {\textbackslash}emph\{search stage\}, instead of searching over a discrete set of candidate feature interactions, we relax the choices to be continuous by introducing the architecture parameters. By implementing a regularized optimizer over the architecture parameters, the model can automatically identify and remove the redundant feature interactions during the training process of the model. In the {\textbackslash}emph\{re-train stage\}, we keep the architecture parameters serving as an attention unit to further boost the performance. Offline experiments on three large-scale datasets (two public benchmarks, one private) demonstrate that AutoFIS can significantly improve various FM based models. AutoFIS has been deployed onto the training platform of Huawei App Store recommendation service, where a 10-day online A/B test demonstrated that AutoFIS improved the DeepFM model by 20.3{\textbackslash}\% and 20.1{\textbackslash}\% in terms of CTR and CVR respectively.},

	abstract = {The chit-chat-based conversational recommendation systems (CRS) provide item recommendations to users through natural language interactions. To better understand user’s intentions, external knowledge graphs (KG) have been introduced into chit-chat-based CRS. However, existing chit-chat-based CRS usually generate repetitive item recommendations, and they cannot properly infuse knowledge from KG into CRS to generate informative responses. To remedy these issues, we first reformulate the conversational recommendation task to highlight that the recommended items should be new and possibly interested by users. Then, we propose the KnowledgeEnriched Conversational Recommendation System (KECRS). Specifically, we develop the Bag-of-Entity (BOE) loss and the infusion loss to better integrate KG with CRS for generating more diverse and informative responses. BOE loss provides an additional supervision signal to guide CRS to learn from both human-written utterances and KG. Infusion loss bridges the gap between the word embeddings and entity embeddings by minimizing distances of the same words in these two embeddings. Moreover, we facilitate our study by constructing a high-quality KG, i.e., The Movie Domain Knowledge Graph (TMDKG). Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that KECRS outperforms state-of-the-art chitchat-based CRS, in terms of both recommendation accuracy and response generation quality.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02342},
	abstract = {Both reviews and user-item interactions (i.e., rating scores) have been widely adopted for user rating prediction. However, these existing techniques mainly extract the latent representations for users and items in an independent and static manner. That is, a single static feature vector is derived to encode her preference without considering the particular characteristics of each candidate item. We argue that this static encoding scheme is difﬁcult to fully capture the users’ preference. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware user-item representation learning model for rating prediction, named CARL. Namely, CARL derives a joint representation for a given user-item pair based on their individual latent features and latent feature interactions. Then, CARL adopts Factorization Machines to further model higher-order feature interactions on the basis of the user-item pair for rating prediction. Speciﬁcally, two separate learning components are devised in CARL to exploit review data and interaction data respectively: review-based feature learning and interaction-based feature learning. In review-based learning component, with convolution operations and attention mechanism, the relevant features for a user-item pair are extracted by jointly considering their corresponding reviews. However, these features are only reivew-driven and may not be comprehensive. Hence, interaction-based learning component further extracts complementary features from interaction data alone, also on the basis of user-item pairs. The ﬁnal rating score is then derived with a dynamic linear fusion mechanism. Experiments on ﬁve real-world datasets show that CARL achieves signiﬁcantly better rating predication accuracy than existing state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with attention mechanism, we show that the relevant information in reviews can be highlighted to interpret the rating prediction.},

Nevertheless, research in the field is still limited, compared to traditional recommender systems. In this work, we propose a novel Question-based recommendation method, Qrec, to assist users to find items interactively, by answering automatically constructed and algorithmically chosen questions. Previous conversational recommender systems ask users to express their preferences over items or item facets. Our model, instead, asks users to express their preferences over descriptive item features. The model is first trained offline by a novel matrix factorization algorithm, and then iteratively updates the user and item latent factors online by a closed-form solution based on the user answers. Meanwhile, our model infers the underlying user belief and preferences over items to learn an optimal question-asking strategy by using Generalized Binary Search, so as to ask a sequence of questions to the user. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed matrix factorization model outperforms the traditional Probabilistic Matrix Factorization model. Further, our proposed Qrec model can greatly improve the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, and it is also effective in the case of cold-start user and item recommendations.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems play a crucial role in our daily lives. Feed streaming mechanism has been widely used in the recommender system, especially on the mobile Apps. The feed streaming setting provides users the interactive manner of recommendation in never-ending feeds. In such a manner, a good recommender system should pay more attention to user stickiness, which is far beyond classical instant metrics and typically measured by long-term user engagement. Directly optimizing long-term user engagement is a non-trivial problem, as the learning target is usually not available for conventional supervised learning methods. Though reinforcement learning (RL) naturally fits the problem of maximizing the long term rewards, applying RL to optimize long-term user engagement is still facing challenges: user behaviors are versatile to model, which typically consists of both instant feedback (e.g., clicks) and delayed feedback (e.g., dwell time, revisit); in addition, performing effective off-policy learning is still immature, especially when combining bootstrapping and function approximation. To address these issues, in this work, we introduce a RL framework — FeedRec to optimize the long-term user engagement. FeedRec includes two components: 1) a Q-Network which designed in hierarchical LSTM takes charge of modeling complex user behaviors, and 2) a S-Network, which simulates the environment, assists the Q-Network and voids the instability of convergence in policy learning. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and a real-world large scale data show that FeedRec effectively optimizes the long-term user engagement and outperforms state-of-the-arts.},

	abstract = {Combinatorial features are essential for the success of many commercial models. Manually crafting these features usually comes with high cost due to the variety, volume and velocity of raw data in web-scale systems. Factorization based models, which measure interactions in terms of vector product, can learn patterns of combinatorial features automatically and generalize to unseen features as well. With the great success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various fields, recently researchers have proposed several DNN-based factorization model to learn both low- and high-order feature interactions. Despite the powerful ability of learning an arbitrary function from data, plain DNNs generate feature interactions implicitly and at the bit-wise level. In this paper, we propose a novel Compressed Interaction Network (CIN), which aims to generate feature interactions in an explicit fashion and at the vector-wise level. We show that the CIN share some functionalities with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We further combine a CIN and a classical DNN into one unified model, and named this new model eXtreme Deep Factorization Machine (xDeepFM). On one hand, the xDeepFM is able to learn certain bounded-degree feature interactions explicitly; on the other hand, it can learn arbitrary low- and high-order feature interactions implicitly. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that xDeepFM outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Almost half of the mapped articles present as a domain Entertainment or Product Review/Evaluation, with the collaborative filtering approach being the most common of the approaches used, and the similarity of friends as the most common of the social components considered. As an evaluation strategy, more than half of the mapped articles use offline experiments in a previously populated database to simulate user actions.

Therefore, this is a challenging and time-consuming task to collate the information and find out most relevant user-job connection mapping according to the skills and preferences of a user. This research work has been done to cover up this same problem and efforts have been made to provide a feasible and efficient solution for the same. We suggest a content-based recommendation engine, which automatically provides best suggestions to users by matching their interests and skills with the features of a job posting. In order to produce an intended recommendation, the proposed engine applies various text filters and feature similarity measurements. Similarity techniques use the bag of n-grams and topic models as the elements of feature vectors. The validations and testing of the model on real data obtained from a top job posting website show the applicability and efficiency of using topic models as features. The approach is generic and can be replicated to different industries.},

Both types of additional information can be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art matrix factorization-based techniques. In this paper, we propose new methods to combine both social and sequential information simultaneously, in order to further improve recommendation performance.

	title = {Towards {Personality}-{Aware} {Recommendation}},
	abstract = {In the last decade new ways of shopping online have increased the possibility of buying products and services more easily and faster than ever. In this new context, personality is a key determinant in the decision making of the consumer when shopping. The two main reasons are: ﬁrstly, a person’s buying choices are inﬂuenced by psychological factors like impulsiveness, and secondly, some consumers may be more susceptible to making impulse purchases than others. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of personality factors on advertisements has been largely neglected at the level of recommender systems. This work proposes a highly innovative research which uses a personality perspective to determine the unique associations among the consumer’s buying tendency and advert recommendations. As a matter of fact, the lack of a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising do not allow both the exploration of this intriguing research direction and the evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms. We present the ADS Dataset, a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising enriched with Big-Five users’ personality factors and 1,200 personal users’ pictures. The proposed benchmark allows two main tasks: rating prediction over 300 real advertisements (i.e., Rich Media Ads, Image Ads, Text Ads) and click-through rate prediction. Moreover, this work carries out experiments, reviews various evaluation criteria used in the literature, and provides a library for each one of them within one integrated toolbox.},

Extreme sparse and large scale data makes online advertising a challenging problem. To achieve better performance and accuracy of the recommendation, a better model with a short turnaround time is needed. In this paper, we address the problem of personalized online advertising for extreme sparse and large scale data. We develop a novel machine learning model (Similarity Powered Pairwise Amplifier Network, SPPAN for short). The complexity of this model (a.k.a. the number of parameters) grows with the amount of observed data, which makes it suitable to extremely sparse data. The training algorithm based on gradient descent makes it easy to parallelize. The similarity model combines the user neighborhood and item neighborhood ideas in collaborative filtering smartly, obtaining a cost-effective way to handle large scale data. The proposed framework is evaluated on a large set of real-world data set from a large internet company (expressed by “Company A”). The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed SPPAN model can greatly improve the prediction and recommendation accuracy on that extreme sparse data set compared with existing approaches.},

However, the intrinsic sparsity of user-item rating data can be problematic in many domains and settings, limiting the ability to generate accurate predictions and effective recommendations. At present, most algorithms use two-valued trust relationship of social network to improve recommendation quality but fail to take into account the difference of trust intensity of each friend and user’s comment information. To this end, the recommendation system within a social network adopts topical attention and probabilistic matrix factorization (STAPMF) is proposed. We combine the trust information in social networks and the topical information from review documents by proposing a novel algorithm combining probabilistic matrix factorization and attention-based recurrent neural networks to extract item underlying feature vectors, user’s personal potential feature vectors, and user’s social hidden feature vectors, which represent the features extracted from the user’s trusted network. Using real-world datasets, we show a significant improvement in recommendation performance comparing with the prevailing state-of-the-art algorithms for social network-based recommendation.},

The company’s recommendation environment displays the following unique characteristics: First, the company’s online and ofﬂine stores sell the same products. Second, fashion products are usually seasonal, so customers’ general preference changes according to the time of year. Last, customers usually purchase items to replace previously preferred items or purchase items to complement those already bought. We propose a new system called K-RecSys, which extends the typical item-based collaborative ﬁltering algorithm by reﬂecting the above domain characteristics. K-RecSys combines online product click data and ofﬂine product sale data weighted to reﬂect the online and ofﬂine preferences of customers. It also adopts a preference decay function to reﬂect changes in preferences over time, and ﬁnally recommends substitute and complementary products using product category information. We conducted an A/B test in the actual operating environment to compare K-RecSys with the existing collaborative ﬁltering system implemented with only online data. Our experimental results show that the proposed system is superior in terms of product clicks and sales in the online shopping mall and its substitute recommendations are adopted more frequently than complementary recommendations.},

This work is a comparative study of fusion methods for outfit recommendation that combine relevant product features extracted from visual and textual data in semantic, multimodal item representations. We compare traditional fusion methods with attention-based fusion methods, which are designed to focus on the fine-grained product features of items. We evaluate the fusion methods on four benchmark datasets for outfit recommendation and provide insights into the importance of the multimodality and granularity of the fashion item representations. We find that the visual and textual item data not only share product features but also contain complementary product features for the outfit recommendation task, confirming the need to effectively combine them into multimodal item representations. Furthermore, we show that the average performance of attention-based fusion methods surpasses the average performance of traditional fusion methods on three out of the four benchmark datasets, demonstrating the ability of attention to learn relevant correlations among fine-grained fashion attributes.},

Fashion style recognition deals with the problem of assigning a person’s outﬁt to a fashion style category. Due to the high similarity between different clothing items and the use of softmax-based loss functions, many of the current methods that address this problem show relatively poor performance and cannot guarantee sufﬁcient 15 inter-class margins in the fashion domain. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method for deep visual recognition by combining a standard CNN architecture with a novel loss function, which we call Additive Cosine Margin Loss (ACML). The proposed function not only projects feature vectors of different classes into different regions of the embedding, but also enforces compactness of the projections within each 20 class. Our experiments were conducted on two public and well-known fashion style recognition datasets FashionStyle14 and HipsterWars, and on the face veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation datasets LFW, YTF, and MegaFace. These experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed loss function over: 1) existing angular margin-based loss functions 2) state-of-the-art methods for clothing style recognition as well as face anal25 ysis tasks.},

In this study, we propose a novel fashion product recommendation method based on both text and image mining techniques. Our model facilitates two kinds of fashion recommendation, namely, similar product and mix-and-match, by leveraging text-based product attributes and image features. To suggest similar products, we construct a new similarity measure to compare the image colour and texture descriptors. For mix-and-match recommendation, we ﬁrstly adopt convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify ﬁne-grained clothing categories and ﬁne-grained clothing attributes from product images. Algorithm is developed to make mix-and-match recommendations by integrating the image extracted categories and attributes information are with text-based product attributes.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of mobile networks and e-commerce, clothing recommendation has achieved considerable success in recent years. Fashion outfit matching has become an essential component to users while shopping, which helps users to select and present items to individuals in a personalized fashion recommendation. Apparently, it is an arduous task to guide complementary clothing matching due to the complexity and subjectivity of fashion items. Some existing solutions have been presented in recent years, which are tending to discover a series of visual cues to establish the matching relations. However, it would be mismatched easily due to these methods being hard to represent all the potential semantic information from the appearance of clothes. To thoroughly make use of the visual characteristics of clothing products and the related description information, we propose a complementary clothing matching method with some compatibility knowledge, named it CCMCK shortly. For visual compatibility, we adopt the graph neural network to model the visual relationship between items. To generate an outfit that satisfies the requirement of fashion compatibility, we propose a matching way under the compatibility constraint and seek to recommend compatible items based on multi-modal compatibility. Finally, we performed a qualitative investigation on the fill-in-the-blank and fashion outfit compatibility tasks to evaluate the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Online stylist service enjoys huge economic potentials due to the trend of transformation of the fashion industry to digitalisation. Existing works either predict the fashion compatibility from the overall aspect or evaluate the compatibility with type-conditional representations. The prediction is hard to interpret due to the abstractive forecast. This paper proposes a visual and semantic representation model for explainable evaluation and recommendation. The model considers fashion compatibility from different factors, such as colour, material and style, by leveraging low to high-level features from former to later layers of CNN. The colour correlation and the pairwise relationship of fashion items in the same outfit are considered during the prediction stage. Instead of just predicting an outfit as compatible or incompatible, the model can classify an outfit as three precise evaluation levels: Good, Normal and Bad. The detailed compatible level is more consistent with the fashion sense of our human brain as Good or Bad outfits may have specific characteristics while Normal outfits tend to be ordinary. Additionally, the model can diagnose and recommend substitutions of the problematic fashion items from overall compatibility or colour-specific aspects by tracking the prediction matrices’ backpropagation gradients during the recommendation stage. Experiments in terms of outfit compatibility prediction and fill in the blank are conducted to evaluate the prediction ability of the proposed model. In contrast, fashion substitution recommendation experiments are conducted to assess the compatibility diagnosis and recommendation ability. Quantitative and qualitative results show that the model enables online stylist services with excellent explainability and generalisation on fashion prediction and recommendation.},

	abstract = {Outﬁts in online fashion data are composed of items of many diﬀerent types (e.g. top, bottom, shoes) that share some stylistic relationship with one another. A representation for building outﬁts requires a method that can learn both notions of similarity (for example, when two tops are interchangeable) and compatibility (items of possibly different type that can go together in an outﬁt). This paper presents an approach to learning an image embedding that respects item type, and jointly learns notions of item similarity and compatibility in an end-toend model. To evaluate the learned representation, we crawled 68,306 outﬁts created by users on the Polyvore website. Our approach obtains 3-5\% improvement over the state-of-the-art on outﬁt compatibility prediction and ﬁll-in-the-blank tasks using our dataset, as well as an established smaller dataset, while supporting a variety of useful queries1.},

	abstract = {In a real-world shopping scenario, users can express their naturallanguage feedback when communicating with a shopping assistant by stating their satisfactions positively with “I like” or negatively with “I dislike” according to the quality of the recommended fashion products. A multimodal conversational recommender system (using text and images in particular) aims to replicate this process by eliciting the dynamic preferences of users from their natural-language feedback and updating the visual recommendations so as to satisfy the users’ current needs through multi-turn interactions. However, the impact of positive and negative natural-language feedback on the effectiveness of multimodal conversational recommendation has not yet been fully explored. Since there are no datasets of conversational recommendation with both positive and negative natural-language feedback, the existing research on multimodal conversational recommendation imposed several constraints on the users’ natural-language expressions (i.e. either only describing their preferred attributes as positive feedback or rejecting the undesired recommendations without any natural-language critiques) to simplify the multimodal conversational recommendation task. To further explore the multimodal conversational recommendation with positive and negative natural-language feedback, we investigate the effectiveness of the recent multimodal conversational recommendation models for effectively incorporating the users’ preferences over time from both positively and negatively natural-language oriented feedback corresponding to the visual recommendations. We also propose an approach to generate both positive and negative natural-language critiques about the recommendations within an existing user simulator. Following previous work, we train and evaluate the two existing conversational recommendation models by using the user simulator with positive and negative feedback as a surrogate for real human users. Extensive experiments conducted on a well-known fashion dataset demonstrate that positive natural-language feedback is more informative relating to the users’ preferences in comparison to negative natural-language feedback.},

The algorithm addresses a broad range of problems in a computationally eﬃcient manner and is therefore enjoying wide use. This tutorial covers the algorithm and its application, illustrating concepts through a range of examples, including Bernoulli bandit problems, shortest path problems, product recommendation, assortment, active learning with neural networks, and reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes. Most of these problems involve complex information structures, where information revealed by taking an action informs beliefs about other actions. We will also discuss when and why Thompson sampling is or is not eﬀective and relations to alternative algorithms.},
